# Enthium v13 + Home Row Mods for Standard Keyboards (Kanata)

Adapted [sunaku's Enthium layout](https://github.com/sunaku/enthium) and [Glove80 keymaps](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) for a standard keyboard with split spacebars using Kanata.

**What I changed:**
- Simplified to 4 layers (Base, Symbol, Nav, Num)
- Left space = Nav layer, Right space = Symbol layer (tap for R)
- Both spaces = Num layer
- Stripped out stuff I didn't need

Based on sunaku's [Engrammer](https://github.com/sunaku/engrammer) family of layouts.

Visual keymaps + Kanata config in my dotfiles.

Docs and editable keymap JSON live in `kanata/docs/README.md`.
